# Learning-python

This is a repo for Los Kinder Guardians (here called `Los Kinder Coders`) to learn Python. It's an open repository, but a work in progress. Use at your own risk.

## Getting started

You'll use a combination of GitHub and GitPod. GitHub is a place to store code, and is the website you're currently on. Create an account.

With your GitHub account, you can head to [GitPod.io](https://gitpod.io/) and sign in using your GitHub login. GitPod is where you will actually write code.

## Why code online?

You can learn to code using your personal computer. The complications that pop-up with coding on a personal computer tend to be too big of a hurdle for most beginning coders. Troubleshooting why an install failed, or a coding component doesn't work can be tricky. 

By using GitHub for storage, and GitPod for development, you're saving yourself some of that troubleshooting hassle. 

If you would like to code locally, [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) can be installed locally.

## Do I need to know Math to program?

Not really. IF you can add `500 + 60` together, you know enough Math to program. This is the kind of Math use in 99% of programming. The other 1% is a bit more complex, and often falls under the category of Discrete Mathematics. This other 1% of Math is used to tell how slow an algorithm might be, or how to sort a list of integers in the best possible way. It's a niche category of programming, and often these sorts of calculations are done for you already.

It's similar to how Aztecross, Datto, and Ehroar figure out numbers and share them the Destiny community. It often happens that smart programmers figure out what's the best approach, and share that knowledge with the coding community. 

It's good to eventually be able to do this kind of Math yourself. But, that's a skill to work on in the future.

## Resources

Some of the resources we'll use for Python are listed.

- https://hyperpolyglot.org/scripting

We will eventually want to create web apps, as part of our learning. To do that, we might need to dabble in a small amount of other languages like Javascript and SQL.
