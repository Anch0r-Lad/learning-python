# learning-python

This is a repo for Los Kinder Guardians (here called `Los Kinder Coders`) to learn Python.

You'll use a combination of GitHub and GitPod. GitHub is a place to store code, and is the website you're currently on. Create an account.

With your GitHub account, you can head to [GitPod.io](https://gitpod.io/) and sign in using your GitHub login. GitPod is where you will actually write code.

## Why do it like this?
You can learn to code using your personal computer. The complications that pop-up with coding on a personal computer tend to be too big of a hurdle for most beginning coders. Troubleshooting why an install failed, or a coding component doesn't work can be tricky. 

By using GitHub for storage, and GitPod for development, you're saving yourself some of that troubleshooting hassle. 

If you would like to code locally, [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) can be installed locally.
